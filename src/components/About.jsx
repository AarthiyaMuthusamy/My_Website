          <p>
            I am a passionate <strong style={{color: '#16d8eaff' }}>Software Developer</strong> with hands-on experience in 
            <strong style={{color: '#04d9ecff' }}> AI, Java, Python, SQL, APIs and full-stack application development, </strong> backed by

            secure, and high-performance software solutions while continuously improving my skills in modern frameworks

            I have contributed to production-grade modules—optimizing backend systems, reducing customer issue escalations, 
            improving uptime, and implementing automation that lowered integration bugs by 20%. My experience in Agile teams 
            has strengthened my ability to collaborate, troubleshoot, and deliver reliable features under tight timelines.

            <li>IoT-Based Ambulance Tracking & Patient Monitoring – Java + Firebase + Arduino</li>
            <li>Student Tracking App – Android + Firebase, role-based access system</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I enjoy combining AI, IoT, backend engineering, and automation to build impactful solutions.
